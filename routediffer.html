            <h1>Routing Table Difference Utility</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/RedDirtBits/routediffer" target="_blank">Source code</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <b>RouteDiffer</b> utility performs an initial log in to a core router or switch and obtains the current routing table and stores it in a JSON file before any work is performed that may affect the routing table (protocol changes, etc.).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Intended to be a <i>Source of Truth</i> as to the state and content of the routing table prior to any work being performed</li>
                <li>If ran, and the source of truth file is not found, it will be created</li>
                <li>Once work has been completed the script is run again</li>
                <li>This will compare the current, post-work, routing table to the source of truth file and if any routes that were in the original file are not present in the current routing table a new file will be created in which stores the missing routes in JSON format</li>
            </ul>
